Social media could use some improvements, and those improvements extend beyond attempting to chastise or regulate dominant platforms into submission.  Regarding privacy, content portability, or desired moderation, the de facto perogative for all of these domains remains tightly coupled with the management of the technical infrastructure underlying our shared digital spaces.  The problems that arise with ever-increasing urgency will not be resolved until the infrastructure problem is tackled directly; perhaps the most blunt approach is to re-architect social media protocols around user-managed servers that communicate with one another relatively free of monolithic intermediaries.  Such a scheme requires adjusting conventional understanding of application servers, the role of individual users and the surrounding community, as well as the typical representations of shared data and the methods used to manipulate it.  In the following, a sketch for re-thinking these concepts is offered.

Various proposals for "fixing" social media either focus on infrastructure or attempt to impose operational requirements on existing platforms, yet the point around which the rest of the debate turns is so rarely discussed.  Federated platforms at least acknowledge the significance of formulating a novel architecture but fall short insofar as the resulting model bottoms out as a "smaller silo" with nearly unbearable integration schemes.  Conversely, proposals for developing a social platform on top of blockchain correctly surmise that an infrastructure solution is warranted but fail to solve any problems such schemes don't themselves introduce.
